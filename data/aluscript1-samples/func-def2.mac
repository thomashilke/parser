# This expression is misparsed. The lexer start to parse '/u',
# think that it is a MACRONAME, but fail when the next char is hit ')',
# and revert back to the previous match, which was '/'. But in the
# process, the character inbetween 'u' has been eaten, and is lost.
# TODO: Correct that.
(exp_2(x,u)=(x-u)/u)

# This one is correctly parsed:
(exp_2(x,u)=(x-u)/ u)
